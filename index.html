                        pre-work phase at Flatiron School's SE Bootcamp, when I knew very little about programming. 
                        I have a firm philosophy that personal growth indicates our strength as a growing professional. 
                        As such, I continue to use and develop this portfolio and you can view the projects I've created
                        to understand how I've grown as a developer. Click <a id="projects" href="projects.html"><em>here</a></em> 
                        to demo the projects I created during phases one through five at Flatiron.
